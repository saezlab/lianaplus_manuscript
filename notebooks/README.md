# LIANA+ Analysis Notebooks

This folder contains the notebooks used to generate the figures in the manuscript.

## Notebooks

Within the `classification/` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce the Label Classification results with MOFA+ and Tensor-cell2cell; these make use of datasets (1-5).

Within the `kuppe` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce the results on Myocardial Infarction (1) data

Within the `spot_calling` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce evaluation results of local metrics; classifying malignant spots from breast cancer data (12) and predicting cell type proportions (5).

Within the `sma` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce the results on Spatial-Metabolome Analysis using the murine Parkinson's disease data (7).

Within `efficiecny` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce the results on the efficiency of LIANA+.

Within `slideseq_benchmark` folder, are the notebooks to reproduce the results on the Slide-seq benchmarking (8).
